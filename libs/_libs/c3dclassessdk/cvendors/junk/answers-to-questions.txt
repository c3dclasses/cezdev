1) If we filter for bachelor degree students and then try to search for SOC-100 it doesn’t come up. I can see and double click on the course in the image though.
I noticed the issue and I have a fix for this is. The javascipt files will be upload this week.


2) We also noticed that when we filter for bachelor degrees MTH-123 does not appear, which seems odd, because it is one of the largest nodes when you select all degrees.    
Do you know if MTH-123, is an ASSOCIATE degree level course? The Excel file shows that it's not a BACHELOR's Level course.

3)      When I review more details of the course and see all the links to the various other courses, what does the number in parentheses mean? For example, PSY-202 (6).
It means that in the original data, The transcripts show that course1 was taken before course2 32 times. (this is the inbound links)
Likewise, the transcripts show that course3 was taken after course2 5 times. (this is the outbound links)

course1 ----(30(inbound))----> course2 ----(5(outbound))----> course3

Details
course2
inbound
course1 (30)
outbound 
course3 (5)

4) Can the list of links to the course in the left hand panel be sorted so that the courses with the most links are at the top?
I added this feature and it will be uploaded this week.

5) There are sliding scale bars on the left, what do these represent?
Those sliding bars represent the feature for filtering edges. 
By default it's set to a minimum of 1 edge weight to a maximum edge weight which is 1822
You can filter the edges of the graph by moving those circles. This feaure will also be in the fix.

6) Is it possible to organize the courses, with the 100-level in the center followed by the 200-, 300-, and highest level on the outer rim?
I believe this is possible. I'm thinking of a way to do this and I will let you know.
